# Introduction

Retail e-commerce has seen rapid growth for many years now, evolving from its beginning in the 1990s and becoming a major component of many businesses. More recently, e-commerce has increased significantly due to the coronavirus pandemic. As people began staying home for long periods of time, many started to rely heavily on online shopping. With the increase in demand for online retail, many businesses have moved their inventory to the internet in order to stay open. In short, e-commerce is probably more important now than ever before, for both consumers and retailers. By analyzing e-commerce data, I hope to gain some experience dealing with real questions that data analysts working in the industry are facing regarding consumer behavior. For example:

* How many customers visited the site in a certain time period?
* What kind of activity went on during that time (viewing, buying, etc.)?
* What products are most frequently purchased?
* What might be some factors that contribute to purchases?

# Data Description

Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store)

The full data contains online shopping information from October 2019 to April 2020. For my analysis, I used the November 2019 data. The data defines an 'event' as one of three shopper actions:
* **view** - a user viewed a product
* **cart** - a user added a product to their shopping cart
* **purchase** - a user purchased a product

The data contains over 67 million events. Other variables include: the date of the event, the product id, the category id, the category code, the brand, the price, the userâ€™s unique id, and user session id.
